# Simple Inventory Management System

This is my first project, a simple command-line based Inventory Management System built with Java. I created this to practice my Java skills and to have a project to store on GitHub.

## üìñ Description

This application allows users to manage a product inventory through a console menu. You can add new products, update the stock of existing products, record sales, and generate a sales report. All data is stored in memory while the application is running.

## ‚ú® Features

The system provides the following features:

* **Add New Product:** Add a new product to the inventory with a unique ID, name, price, and quantity.
* **Update Inventory:** Increase or decrease the stock quantity of an existing product.
* **Record Sales:** Record the sale of a product, which updates its stock and calculates revenue.
* **Generate Sales Report:** Display a report of all products, showing the quantity sold and the total revenue generated for each. It also calculates the overall total revenue from all sales.
* **View Inventory:** Display a list of all products currently in the inventory with their details.
